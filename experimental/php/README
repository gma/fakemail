OVERVIEW

fakemail is a fake mail server that captures emails as files for acceptance
testing. This avoids the excessive configuration of setting up a real mail
server and trying to extract mail queue content.

This is the PHP implementation of fakemail. The original version is
written in Perl. Both versions are available from the fakemail project web
site. See http://fakemail.sourceforge.net/ for more details.

INSTALLATION

Just copy the files to a directory and adjust the path to your PHP-Cli in
fakemail.php for *nix and fakemail.cmd for windows. You might need to install
ext/sockets.

USAGE

    # ./fakemail.php --help
    
    or
    
    # fakemail --help

REMARKS

The --background switch requires ext/pcntl
